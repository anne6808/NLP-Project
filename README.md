# NLP-Project
Shared github for the 3832 Final Project 

FOR TRAINING DISTILBERT:

In the Drive linked at the bottom there is a zipped file called content. It has to be extracted and be in distilBERT training directory. After it has been unzipped and is in the distilBERT folder, remove the zip file. Inside the distilBERT folder is the python notebook for training distilbert.

FOR TRAINING T5-SMALL:

In the Drive linked at the bottom there are two datasets that need to be downloaded and uploaded to the content page on COLAB. These are the train-v2.0.json and modified_squad_data.json. Once the datasets are uploaded, run all cells.
